# 550 Game Play Analysis IV

SELECT ROUND(COUNT(distinct T.player_id ) / COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id),2) AS fracTION
FROM activity a
LEFT JOIN 
(SELECT player_id, min(event_date) as first_login
FROM activity 
GROUP BY player_id) T
ON a.player_id = T.player_id
AND DATE_SUB(a.event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = T.first_login

# STEP 1 - Create a subquery T to find the first login date (min(event_date)) for each player_id.
# STEP 2 - Perform a LEFT JOIN between the activity table and subquery T on matching player_id and where a.event_date is one day after T.first_login.
# STEP 3 - Count the distinct player_ids from the joined table where the condition matches.
# STEP 4 - Calculate the fraction by dividing the count from Step 3 by the total distinct player_ids in the activity table.
# STEP 5 - Round the fraction to 2 decimal places and return it as fracTION
