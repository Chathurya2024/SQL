# 1731 The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee

# SOLUTION - 1
SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, report_data.reports_count, report_data.average_age
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT reports_to, COUNT(*) AS reports_count, ROUND(AVG(age),0) AS average_age
    FROM employees
    WHERE reports_to IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY reports_to
) report_data
ON e.employee_id = report_data.reports_to
ORDER BY e.employee_id;

# STEP 1 - INNER JOIN same table
# STEP 2 - In the join function using GROUP BY I got count and AVG age 
# STEP 3 - Now I have joined all the columns and arranged them in order by their ID
# STEP 4 - Final step is to call all the columns from both the tables

# SOLUTION - 2

SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, COUNT(b.employee_id) AS reports_count, ROUND(AVG(b.age),0)  AS average_age
FROM employees e
JOIN employees b
ON e.employee_id = b.reports_to
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.name
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
