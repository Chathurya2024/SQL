# 180 Consecutive Numbers

#Consecutive numbers
#STEP 1 - istwo inner join table where num value is equal and id from table b is one less than a
#STEP 2 - we repeat the same process
#STEP 3 - Then we Group them by num and return it as consecutive number

SELECT a.num AS ConsecutiveNums 
FROM logs a 
JOIN logs b ON a.num = b.num AND a.id = b.id-1
JOIN logs c ON a.num = c.num AND b.id = c.id-1
GROUP BY a.num
