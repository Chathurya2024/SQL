SELECT * FROM Patients
WHERE conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%'  
   OR conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%'    
   OR conditions LIKE '% DIAB1'    
   OR conditions = 'DIAB1'

# STEP 1 - Query the Patients table to find records where the conditions column contains the term 'DIAB1'.
# STEP 2 - Use LIKE with different patterns to match 'DIAB1' at different positions:
% DIAB1% matches 'DIAB1' with a space before and after.
DIAB1% matches 'DIAB1' at the beginning.
% DIAB1 matches 'DIAB1' at the end with a preceding space.
conditions = 'DIAB1' matches the exact term 'DIAB1'.
# STEP 3 - Return all columns for the matched records.
