# 1174 Immediate Food Delivery II
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0/ COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS order_date
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
);

# STEP 1 - Find the first `order_date` for each `customer_id` using a subquery.
# STEP 2 - Filter the `Delivery` table to include only the earliest orders from Step 1.
# STEP 3 - Use `CASE` to count how many of these orders match the `customer_pref_delivery_date`.
# STEP 4 - Calculate the percentage of matching orders over total unique customers and round it.
# STEP 5 - Return the result as `immediate_percentage`.
