# 1907 Count Salary Categories

SELECT categories.category, COUNT(T.account_id) AS accounts_count
FROM (SELECT account_id, income, CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary' WHEN income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'Average Salary' ELSE 'High Salary' END AS category FROM accounts) T
RIGHT JOIN (SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category UNION ALL SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category UNION ALL SELECT 'High Salary' AS category
) AS categories
ON T.category = categories.category
GROUP BY categories.category
ORDER BY accounts_count DESC;

# STEP 1 - Create a subquery T that categorizes each account_id based on income into 'Low Salary', 'Average Salary', or 'High Salary'.
# STEP 2 - Create another subquery categories with all possible salary categories ('Low Salary', 'Average Salary', 'High Salary').
# STEP 3 - Perform a RIGHT JOIN between T and categories to ensure all categories are included, even if no accounts fall into them.
# STEP 4 - Group by category to count the number of accounts in each salary category.
# STEP 5 - Order the results by accounts_count in descending order.
