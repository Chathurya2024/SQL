# 1251 Average Selling Price
# SOLUTION
SELECT p.product_id, ifnull(round(sum(u.units*p.price)/sum(u.units),2),0) as average_price
FROM prices p
LEFT JOIN unitssold u 
ON u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date and p.product_id = u.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id

#HINT
# STEP 1 - Join Table
# STEP 2 - Calculate Average Price and round up the decimal. Use IFNULL to return 0 if no units are sold.
# STEP 3 - Group Results
# STEP 4 - Return product_id and average_price
