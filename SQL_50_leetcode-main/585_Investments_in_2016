SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016),2) AS tiv_2016
FROM insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015

AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
ORDER BY tiv_2015, pid;

# STEP 1 - Filter insurance records where tiv_2015 has more than one distinct pid (policyholder ID).
# STEP 2 - Further filter to include only records with unique (lat, lon) combinations.
# STEP 3 - Calculate the sum of tiv_2016 for these filtered records and round it to 2 decimal places.
# STEP 4 - Return the result ordered by tiv_2015 and pid.
