# STEP 1 - Create a summary table c with visited_on and total amount per day.
# STEP 2 - Self-join c to calculate cumulative sums and averages for a rolling 7-day period.
# STEP 3 - Filter to include only dates starting from 6 days after the earliest visit.
# STEP 4 - Group by visited_on to get daily totals and averages.
# STEP 5 - Order the results by date in ascending order.
